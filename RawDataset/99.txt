97 Which Students Try to Bully Others? Bullying can be very confusing. Getting more information can help. A student who bullies may be a boy or a girl. A student who bullies may be older or younger than me. A student who bullies may be alone or with others. A student who bullies may: • Do something that makes other students laugh • Do something that causes an adult to feel upset or angry • Do something that I know is wrong, or that I guess may be wrong • Use an unkind face and words • Use a friendly face and confusing words If I feel confused or have questions about bullying, it’s a smart decision to get more informa- tion from adults. Adults were children many years ago. They remember students who bullied them. An adult can help me decide if someone is trying to bully me. n178 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
