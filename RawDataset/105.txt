Understanding adultscan make it easier to work and playwith them.Adults are older people. They werechildren long ago. They would stillbe children if they hadn’t been herefor so long. They couldn’t help it;they didn’t decide to be adults. Itwasn’t a choice that they made. Theyjust kept growing older.Sometimes, it helps to think of adults as really, really, really old children. Children like to havefun. So do adults. Children like to eat their favorite foods (and snacks that may not quite befood). So do adults. Children like to play. So do adults. Children have feelings. So do adults.Thinking of adults as really, really, really old children may help me to remember that eachadult was once a child, like me. Adults may be easier to understand if I try to remember thatthey were once children, too.Someday, I will be an adult. My turn as an adult is on its way—it’s closer each day. Until then,I will try to remember that adults were children once, too. This may make adults a little easierfor me to understand. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 195© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
