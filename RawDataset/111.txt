109It Was Fun but Now We’re DoneThere are times when adults start a fun activity withchildren. There are also times when children find afun thing to do on their own.All fun activities end. Adults are used to having funactivities end. So they often handle it better thanchildren. Little by little, children learn to end funactivities, too.It is helpful to know when a fun activity needs toend. So, an adult may say, “In a few minutes, wehave to put the toys away.” This means playtimewill end soon, but not now.A few minutes pass. Then, an adult may say, “Itwas fun, but now we’re done.” This is a special sen-tence. It means that the fun activity ends now. It’stime to put things away. It’s time to go to anotheractivity or task.Sometimes, children think, There will be another time for fun. This helps them to stay calmand cooperative. They are right, too. There will be another fun time.When I hear the special sentence, “It was fun, but now we’re done,” I will try to think of funtimes to come. When a fun activity ends, I will try to stay calm and cooperative. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 203© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
