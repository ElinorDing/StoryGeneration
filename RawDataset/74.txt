72 Why Do People Shake Hands? People shake hands for many reasons. They shake hands when they meet someone for the first time, or to greet someone that they have not seen for a while. Some- times people shake hands as they leave a party or gathering. When people agree on a plan or a contract together, they may shake hands to “seal the deal.” In each case, a handshake is used as a friendly gesture. People who study history believe that people began using handshakes several hundred years ago in England. During that time, adults sometimes carried weapons. Men would sometimes hide weapons up their left sleeve. Extending the left arm, and shaking the hand of another person, was a gesture to show that neither person was hiding a weapon. Later, when carrying a weapon was not common anymore, handshakes switched to the right hand. People shake hands for many reasons. It’s likely that handshaking, with such a long history, will probably be a gesture that people will use for many years to come. n146 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
