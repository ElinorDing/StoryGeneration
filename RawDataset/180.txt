178 Why Do We Have to Go? Many children have questions about evacuation. Often they want to know why their family has to evacuate the house. Sometimes children will ask their mom or dad, “Why do we have to go?” When firefighters tell a family to evacuate, it’s very, very, very important for people to leave their house. Firefighters have studied fires for a long time. They are fire experts. Firefighters decide when a fire is too close and people have to evacuate their houses. It’s intelli- gent to listen and follow their directions. Sometimes, it may seem that a fire is not that close. It may seem like it would be okay to stay. The problem is, when a fire is out of control it spreads quickly. That is why firefighters ask families to evacuate when it is still safe to go, before the fire is very close. Firefighters decide when a fire is too close. They tell people when it is time to evacuate. If a firefighter says, “It’s time to evacuate,” it’s time to evacuate. Following the directions of firefighters helps people stay safe. n294 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
