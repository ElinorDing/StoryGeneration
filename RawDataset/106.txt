104 Learning to Respect Adults Adults were here before me. Their birth dates came before mine. It’s important for children to understand that adults are adults. Adults have been here a long time. Adults have read more, studied more, and learned more. For this reason, adults make most of the decisions. That’s Life on Planet Earth. Sometimes, children wish that they could make adult decisions. Adults were once children who wished that at times, too. Now that they are adults, they’ve learned how difficult it can be to make decisions. Understanding this may make it easier for children to respect adults and the decisions that they make. I am a child. I am learning about adults. Adults have been here a long time. They have a lot of experience. They know a lot. I will try to respect adults, and the deci- sions that they make. n196 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
