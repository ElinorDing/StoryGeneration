7Children Grow Kind Of SlowChildren grow. 
Sometimes, an adult will look at a child and say, “You’re growing up so fast!”
If children really grew really fast, their feet would be farther away every time they looked down!
Compared to many of the animals on Planet Earth, children grow kind of slow. 
Their bodies change little by little. 
Hamsters are adults at six months of age. 
Kittens become cats with in one to three years. 
Puppies become dogs between two and three years of age. 
Most people become adults between eighteen and twenty-five years of age.
Children are busy people. So, they may not notice that they are growing. 
Then, one day their clothing or shoes are too small. 
When this happens, being bigger may seem a little surprising.
Getting bigger is a part of growing up. Compared to some animals, children grow rather slow. 
That’s why children often don’t notice getting bigger until their clothes are too small.
