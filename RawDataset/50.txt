48 What Is Comfortable? Comfortable is a nice, safe feeling. Comfortable may mean that nothing on my body hurts, scratches, itches, or stings. I don’t feel cold or hot, I feel just right. My skin feels good. The skin on my head, nose, fingers, and toes feels good. Comfortable may mean that nothing in my body hurts or aches. No head- ache or stomachache. No sprains or broken bones. No bad sounds. Nothing that tastes bad. I feel good inside. Comfortable may mean that my feelings all feel good. I am not worried. I am not afraid. I do not feel sad, bad, anxious, or confused. For many people, knowing what to do, and how to do it, is comfortable. I feel happy, calm, and comfortable. My feelings feel good. Comfortable may mean that a place or thing feels good and safe. There are things and places that feel nice and safe, like a chair or a favorite room. Comfortable may mean that it feels nice and safe to be around another person. Sometimes, everything in me and around me feels good. When that happens, I am com- pletely comfortable. Comfortable is a nice, safe feeling. n 98 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
