144 What Is Practice? Students learn many important skills. Reading is a skill. Math, writing, and spelling are skills, too. Prac- tice is one way that students learn. Sometimes, teachers ask students to practice skills. Practice is carefully doing a skill over and over. When students learn to add, they practice by solving many math problems. When students learn to write, they practice making letters by writing each letter many times. When students learn to spell a word, they practice spelling it correctly. Practice helps students learn many important skills. n252 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition Â© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
