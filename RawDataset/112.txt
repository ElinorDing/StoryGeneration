110 Please Hurry Up! Parents often say, “Hurry up!” What might a parent be thinking? At different times of the day, what might ‘hurry up’ mean? On a school day morning, ‘hurry up’ may mean I don’t want you to be late … or … please move faster as you get ready for school! Once in a while, ‘hurry up’ may mean finish- ing an activity in another way, like finishing a piece of toast in the car instead of at the kitchen table. At home during free time, ‘hurry up’ may mean come now. It’s time to leave an activ- ity until later. Sometimes parents say, “Hurry up!” Knowing what ‘hurry up’ means may make it easier to follow their request. n204 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
