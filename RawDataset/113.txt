When this happens, children need to ask for permission.Permission is something that adults give to children. It’s not a thing like a toy or chocolate.Permission is an okay to go ahead with an idea. Sometimes children get the permission thatthey need, other times they don’t.Here are two examples:Antoine has an idea. He wants to take Jasper, his hamster, outside. Antoine’s idea is hismom’s decision to make. So Antoine asks his mom, “May I take Jasper outside?” Antoine’smom says, “Not right now.” Not right now means, No, not at this time. Jasper the hamsterstays inside.Brooklyn wants to pick flowers. She asks her dad, “May I pick a flower from our garden?”Her dad says, “Sure.” Sure means, It’s okay for Brooklyn to pick one flower. Picking more thanone flower may be a problem, because Brooklyn got her dad’s permission to pick only oneflower.Sometimes when children ask for permission, the answer means no. Other times whenchildren ask for permission, the answer means yes.Permission is needed when a child has an idea, and it’s an adult’s decision to make. Some-times children get the permission that they need, other times they don’t.
