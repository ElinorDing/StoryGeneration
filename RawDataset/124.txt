122 The Up Escalator In our community, people share the up escalators. An escalator is a moving set of stairs. An escalator is a good way to move people from one floor to another. On a staircase, people move up from one step to the next. On an up escalator, people choose a step and ride it to the top! To be safe, it’s important to hold the handrail. The handrail moves at the same speed as the step. This makes an up escalator comfortable and safe for people to use. Here’s how to use an up escalator: • Walk slowly to the bottom of the escalator. • Pause just a little to decide which empty step to ride. • Place a hand on the handrail next to that step. • Look down, step with one foot, then the other, onto that step. This may be a big step. • Ride up. To ride safely, stay on the same step. • As the top gets closer, keep holding the handrail. • At the top, the step begins to slowly flatten as it slides away under the landing. When this happens, let go of the handrail and walk off.222 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.Most escalators are wide enough for two people to share a step. Sometimes I may have myown step. Other times, my mom, dad, brother, sister, or someone else that I know may ridewith me.Once in a while, an up escalator may be very, very busy. There are people waiting to usethe escalator, and people on almost every step. When this happens, I may be told to share astep. At the top, it will be important to walk a few extra steps before stopping. This will leaveenough room for other people to get off of the escalator. The people in my community safely try to share the up escalators. I will try to safely share the up escalators, too. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 223© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
