2 Learning with Stories People learn from stories. 
People often tell one another their experiences. 
As they listen, they learn. 
Once, my mom was teaching me to tie my shoes. 
She told me a story about how her grandfather taught her to tie her shoes. 
I tried it, practiced it, and learned how to tie my shoes. 
Another time, I was afraid to go down the slide on the school playground. 
I wanted to try it. 
I stood and watched other children climb the stairs of the slide, sit on the top, and slide down. 
I wondered if I could do that. My kindergarten teacher, Mr. Burns, came up and stood next to me. 
He told me a story. When he was a boy, he was afraid of going down the slide, too. 
“Did you try it?” I asked. 
He said he did. Mr. Burns said it really helped to look up as he climbed the stairs. 
I thought that might work for me. 
I went down the slide, and it was okay! 
Last Tuesday it was raining. 
I didn’t want to wear my raincoat. 
My sister, Madison, said it might be better to “just wear it.” 
Then she told me a story. 
One day last year, it was raining. She didn’t wear her raincoat to school. 
She got wet. Madison was cold, damp, and uncomfortable for the first hour of class. 
I decided to wear my raincoat to be dry and comfortable. 
I am learning each day. People keep telling me their stories. 
I will try to keep listening, and learning.
