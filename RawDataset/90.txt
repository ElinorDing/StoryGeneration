88 Learning to Chew Gum I am learning about how people chew gum. Sometimes gum comes in a wrapper. This keeps it clean. It’s important to take the gum out of the wrapper before putting it in my mouth. Some people save the gum wrapper to use again when they are done chewing the gum. When gum is done, it is thrown away. When I am done chewing my gum, I may cover it with the gum wrapper and put it in a waste basket. Many people, like my mom, dad, and grand- parents, know how to chew gum. If I have questions as I learn about chewing gum, they can help. n164 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
