140 Using Respect at School Respect is being careful and thoughtful with other people. People show respect with kind words and actions. Respect helps everyone feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. Teachers and students try to show respect at school. Here are some examples: • Respect is using kind words and actions. When Miss Jacobs works with her fifth graders, she often uses a kind voice and a smile. • Respect is carefully helping another student. Samantha dropped the envelope with her book-fair money in the hallway. Jose saw it fall. He picked up the envelope and said, “Here, Samantha. You dropped this.” • Respect is sharing. Aidan needed a blue marker. Jenna had one. “Here,” Jenna said to Aidan, “You may use mine.” • “Thank you, Jenna,” said Aidan. Saying “thank you” shows respect, too! • Respect is working quietly when others are trying to think, or finish their assignments. Tristan finished his work first. He read a book silently until the test was over. Respect is being careful and thoughtful with other people. At school, respect helps every- one feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. n248 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
