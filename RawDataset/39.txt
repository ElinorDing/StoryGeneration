37 The Transformers around Us BUTTERFLIES Life is full of real transformers. They change their form—and how they look—following a biological plan. A butterfly is a real transformer. Its life cycle is a biological plan with four stages. First, there’s an egg that is laid on a leaf near butterfly food. It isn’t an egg for long. Second, the egg becomes a caterpillar. Caterpillars may have stripes or patches. They eat and grow. Their skin becomes too small. They shed it. A caterpillar grows fast. It may have to shed its skin four or more times. The third stage is a pupa (also called a chrysalis or cocoon). This is the transformation stage. On the outside, a cocoon looks still. It’s silent. On the inside, a lot is happening. The caterpillar is changing into a butterfly. The fourth stage is the adult butterfly. Many butterflies have colorful wings. They can fly. They lay eggs, near food, that grow into caterpillars, and then cocoons, to become butterflies. Some of the changes around us are transformations that follow a plan, over and over again. They are quiet transformations that are an important part of Life on Planet Earth. n 80 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
