112 Many Adults Like to Say “Yes” Children have many ideas. They have ideas about things they would like to do. A child’s idea may be an adult’s decision to make. When this happens, children need to ask for permission. Children may be surprised to learn that most adults like to say “yes” whenever they can. For many adults, giving permission and saying “yes” is fun. It’s definitely more fun than saying “no.” Long ago, when adults were children, they had to ask for permis- sion. They remember how fun it was when adults said “yes” to them. They want to be fun like that, now. Still, adults may decide to say “no.” It’s their decision to make. They may wish they could say “yes.” But, they are adults. They’ve learned a lot. It’s an adult’s job to think and make the best decision that they can. This is why they may say “no.” Children have many ideas. Some of them need permission. For many adults, saying “yes” is fun. As adults, though, it’s their job to think and make the best decision. Once in a while, the best decision isn’t “yes”; it’s “no.” n206 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
