123 Eating at the Food Court My family is going to the mall. We may eat at the food court. The food  court is a big area with many food vendors. Food vendors are small fast food restaurants. There is one big area where people can sit and eat. People choose a vendor, buy food, and then sit and eat at an open table. People who work there work fast. They ask questions fast. They fill orders fast. They like it when custom- ers make choices fast, too. When a family eats at the food court, each person may choose their favorite vendor, and then eat together at the same table. Or, a family may decide to use one food vendor. It’s my parents’ decision to make. Once my family decides which vendor or vendors to use, we may follow these steps to get our food: 1.	Get in line. We may be first. If there are other people in a line before us, they will be order- ing their food before us. If the person in front of us glances at us quickly, it may mean that we are standing too close. It’s hard to know for sure. Whether or not this is the case, taking a step back may help.224 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.2.	Order food. To know when to order food, it helps to watch the person taking the orders closely. When it is our turn to order, that person may glance at us. He may also say some- thing very fast. For example, he may say something like, “And for you?” or “Okay.” This, that glance, and being next in line means that it is time for us to order.3.	Place food on tray. Parents can help with this.4.
