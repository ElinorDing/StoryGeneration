130 Class Schedules My name is Caitlyn. I am in Mrs. Jones class. Our class has a schedule. Mrs. Jones made our class schedule. It is a plan for our class. It lists what we do on most school days. Sometimes, Mrs. Jones will decide to follow another plan. The schedule will list an activity, and we will do another activity instead. This is okay. When this happens, Mrs. Jones will tell us about the new plan. We may follow the posted schedule tomorrow. Most of the time, our class schedule matches what Mrs. Jones tells us to do. Sometimes, we’ll have another plan. When this happens, I will try to do what Mrs. Jones tells us to do. n236 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
