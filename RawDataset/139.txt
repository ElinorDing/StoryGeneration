137Lining up at the DoorThere are many students at my school. Some-times my teacher tells the students to ‘lineup at the door.’ Lining up at the door usuallymeans we will all be walking to another place.When we ‘line up at the door’ we try to standone student behind the other. One studentis first. A second student stands behind thefirst. A third student stands behind the sec-ond. Except for the first student, each studentstands behind another student in the line.The line stands for a few moments. Some-times it may feel a little crowded or squishy.This often happens when many studentsstand in a small space. Sometimes childrentuck in their shirts or scratch their heads.Sometimes students just wiggle a little. Theymay touch students around them as they dothese things.My teacher may ask us to ‘stand still.’ This makes standing in a line more comfortable andgets us ready to walk.When my teacher tells us to line up at the door, it helps to know what it means and whatto expect. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 245© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
