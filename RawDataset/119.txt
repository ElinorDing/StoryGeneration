117The Truth about MessesMy family lives in a home. We eat, take baths, sleep, get dressed, play, and work there.Sometimes, we make a mess.When we eat, pots, pans, and plates get dirty. This can make a mess.When we get ready for bed, we take off dirty clothes, put on pajamas, brush teeth, findbedtime stories, and find Slowmo, my turtle. This can make a mess.When we sleep, the sheets get rumpled and our pajamas sometimes end up on the floor inthe morning. It’s starting to get messy already!When we get dressed, things can get messy, too.My family loves to play. That can really make a mess!Sometimes Mom and Dad go outside to “clean up the yard. ” Uh oh—does that get messy,too?There’s one true thing about messes: A mess is a mess until someone cleans it up.A person might sit there, and look at a mess, and hope it will go away. Without help fromthat person, the mess will stay.The truth about messes is that only people can make them go away. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 215© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
