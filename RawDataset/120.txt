118 Restating with Respect at Home I am learning about respect. Respect helps everyone in my family feel important, comfortable, and safe. Talking respectfully to parents is a skill. It takes practice. Sometimes, children make mistakes with respect. A child may use a disre- spectful tone of voice or words. Talking disrespectfully to a parent is a mistake. Parents want their children to feel comfortable and happy, and to use respect with others. If my brothers, my sisters, or I make a mistake with respect, my parents say, “Restate with respect, please.” “Restate with respect” gives us an important second chance. It gives us a chance to think. Next, we try to say it again with a calm voice and cooperative words. We try to say the same thing, but with respect. If my mom or dad says to me, “Restate with respect, please,” that means that I have made a mistake with respect. I will try to think and say it again using a calm voice and cooperative words. I will try to say it again with respect. Many children make mistakes with respect. With practice, they learn how to talk to their parents with respect. n216 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
