Thetadpoles grow back legs, then front legs, and theirtails shrink.The third stage is a frog. People often think of frogsas green. A frog may be other colors, too. Some frogschange colors. Frogs lay eggs that grow into tadpoles,to become frogs.Some of the changes around us are transformationsthat follow a plan, over and over again.
