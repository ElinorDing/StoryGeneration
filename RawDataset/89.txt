87Using “Excuse Me” toMove through a CrowdOnce in a while, I will be one person in a crowd. A crowd is many people sharing a spacetogether. Often a crowd of people have to stand close together to share the space that isavailable. This makes it difficult if one person has to get through the group to another place.Here’s an example. A popular movie opened last week at our movie theatre. My dad andI went to see it. We already had our tickets, and wanted to get some popcorn. There weremany people waiting in the lobby for the theatre doors to open. The popcorn was on theother side of the lobby from my dad and me. This was a good time for me to practice whatto say and do to move through a crowd. I began by facing the line for popcorn. Then I said, “Excuse me.” People began to move aside, so once in a while, I would say, “Thank you.” I kept moving slowly. I had to keep repeating “excuse me” every few steps. That way, I could use a friendly voice that wasn’t too loud for a movie theatre lobby. A little smile seemed to help, too. With me in front and Dad behind me, we made it to the popcorn line a few slow steps at a time. Dad says he’s proud that I practiced using “Excuse me” at the theatre. I felt proud, too, to see it work! nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 163© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
