42 Thomas Edison and Mistakes Thomas Edison was an inventor. Inventors have new ideas and create things for the very first time. Inven- tors make mistakes and know how to learn from them. Thomas Edison made many mistakes. He stayed calm. That way, he could  do his best thinking and learn from his mistakes. He helped to invent the light bulb and many other things, too. Thomas Edison expected to make mistakes. For inventors, mistakes are an important part of their work. It’s smart to know how to handle mistakes. Staying calm is important. A calm body helps a brain think and solve problems efficiently and effectively. (In this case, efficiently and effectively means that the brain is working at its very best!) Many students learn to stay calm when they make a mistake. This helps them think well, and solve their problems efficiently and effectively. They learn to use mistakes to their advantage, just like Thomas Edison. A brain works best in a calm body. Like many other students, I am learning to stay calm when I make a mistake. This will help my brain to work at its best! n 88 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
