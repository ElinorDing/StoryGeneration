My sister Emily uses the toilet, shower, and sink in our bathroom. My brother Austin uses the toilet, shower, and sink in our bathroom. I use the toilet, shower, and sink in our bathroom. Each of us needs to use the toi- let, take a shower, and brush our teeth. To be fair, each of us needs time in the bathroom. Shorter showers can help. When Emily takes a shorter shower, Austin or I can use the bathroom sooner. When Austin takes a shorter shower, Emily or I can use the bathroom sooner.
