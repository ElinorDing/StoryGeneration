77 Thanking People for the Nice Things That They Say Sometimes people say something helpful or kind. Saying “thank you” after someone says something nice means, What you said to me is helpful or What you said to me is kind. There are many times when saying “thank you” is a smart and friendly thing to do. Sometimes people help me. Yes- terday, I had a question about our math assignment. Sydney sits next to me in class. She remembered the assignment. She said, “We have to do all the problems on page 32.” I said, “Thanks.” That’s a shorter way to say “thank you.” Sometimes people say kind things to me. Last week on my birthday I wore a new shirt to school. My teacher said, “Happy Birthday! Nice shirt, too!” It’s easy for people to remember their own birthday, harder to remember someone else’s birthday. I said, “Thanks,” to my teacher. Thank you is a friendly phrase that means, It was nice of you to say that! I will try say “thank you” when people say nice things to me. That way, they will know that I heard the nice things that they said to me. n152 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
