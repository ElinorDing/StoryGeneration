171 Jet Way Lines May Be Slow at Times Planes fly in and out of airports. Many times a jet way is used to connect an airplane to an airport. People walk in the jet way to get onto a plane. Sometimes, passengers need to stop and wait in the jet way. Knowing why this happens helps people stay calm. Passenger airplanes have many seats. This gives each person a place to sit on the plane. It doesn’t leave a lot of room for people to walk. When fifty, one hundred, or more people get on a plane, the aisle fills up very quickly. A line forms out into the jet way. Meanwhile, other passengers are already in the airplane, getting settled into their seats. Sometimes they have to take off their coats, put their luggage away, or help another passenger. All of this takes time, especially when there are a lot of passengers. Jet way lines can be slow at times. Jet way lines often stop, then move, then stop, then move. Even so, it is the fastest way to get many people with bags and luggage down one aisle and into their seats. Most passengers would rather be in their seats than standing in a slow jet way line. They may feel a little uncomfortable or frustrated. It’s important to try to stay calm. Sometimes thinking can help. Passengers may think, This is what happens when two hundred people get on an airplane, or, The line will move again soon, or, Others will wait for me when I am getting settled into my seat. Thinking to stay calm in a jet way is smart. I may use a jet way to get onto a plane. If there are many people, the line may move slowly. The line of people, with me in it, may need to stop and wait now and then. This is okay. I will try to think to stay calm. This is smart for me, and helpful for the passengers around me. n286 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
