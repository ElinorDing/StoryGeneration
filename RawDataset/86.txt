84 What Is Respect? I am learning about respect. Respect is being careful and thoughtful with other people. People show respect with kind words and actions. Respect helps everyone feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. At home, parents and children show respect when they use kind words and actions. Respect helps a family to feel comfortable and safe. At school, teachers and students show respect when they use kind words and actions. Respect helps everyone in a classroom feel com- fortable and safe. I will try to be careful and thought- ful with other people. I will try to use kind words and actions. I will try to use respect to help everyone feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. n160 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition Â© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
