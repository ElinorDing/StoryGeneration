107 Adults Make Many Big Decisions Adults make many decisions. Some people think that the biggest decisions are those that are made for other peo- ple. Moms and dads are adults. They make many decisions for their chil- dren. Teachers are adults. They make a lot of the decisions for their students.  As children grow, they make more deci- sions for themselves. Babies don’t make many decisions, toddlers make a few more, preschoolers make a few more, and so on. Teenagers make more decisions than they ever did before, but not as many as they will make as adults. Adults make many big decisions every day. Adults decide when it’s okay for their children to have snacks or candy. They decide whether it’s okay to allow their children to play computer games before homework is done. Teachers decide the best way to help students learn. The list of big decisions that adults make is very, very, very long. Children may be able to help in decision-making. Sometimes, being quiet while adults think is helpful. Once in a while, children are asked for their ideas before a decision is made. For example, parents may ask their children where they would like to go for a vacation. When an adult makes a big decision, it’s really helpful if children respect it. Each day, adults make many big decisions for other people. Children may be able to help. n200 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
