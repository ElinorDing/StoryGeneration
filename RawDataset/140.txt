138 Will I be First in Line? Sometimes my class forms a line. Once in a while, I will be first. Most of the time I will be in another place in the line. When my teacher says, “Please line up at the door,” we form a line. One student is first, one child is second, another is third, and so on. Each student has a place in line. We use our line to walk safely to another place. I like to be first in line. Once in a while and what may seem like almost never, I will be the first student in the line. When this happens, the teacher is right in front of me. Most students want to be first in line, just like me. To be fair, we take turns. That’s why most of the time another student is first in line. When this happens one of my classmates will be in front of me. This is okay. Sometimes my class forms a line. Once in a while, I will be first. Most of the time one of my classmates will be first. This is fair and okay. n246 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
