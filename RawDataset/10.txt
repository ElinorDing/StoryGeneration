8 Why Do I Need New Clothes? 
I’m a child, and I am growing taller and bigger. 
All children grow. 
Their clothes stay the same size. 
For this reason, children’s clothing fits for a few months or so.  
The time comes when clothing is too small. Shoes may fit tight and toes may feel crowded inside shoes. 
Or, pants are tight or short. Sometimes, shirts get hard to button. 
It’s time for new clothes. 
I need new clothes because I get bigger, and my clothes stay the same size.
