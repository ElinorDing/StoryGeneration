93 How to Lose a Game and Win Friends Children often play games. Sometimes I play games with others. I may win a game. Other times, another person wins. This happens when people play games. Winning is often a good feeling that is easy to control. Losing is harder to handle. Knowing how to lose can help me keep friends. Children like to feel safe and comfortable when they play games. When they play with someone who suddenly becomes very upset, it can be a little frightening. It’s not much fun. It feels uncomfortable. For this reason, staying in good control of feelings is one way to make and keep friends. As children grow, friends become very important. So, they learn what to think, say, and do to stay in control when they lose. First, here are some thoughts that help children stay in control when they lose: • “I want the other children to play with me again sometime.” • “Oh well, I did have fun playing the game.” • “I may win the next time.” A child may think of something else to stay in good control, too.170 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.Second, when a child loseshe may say,• “You won!” or• “Good game!” or• “Good job!” or• “Oh boy, and I thought I was going to win.” or• “Let’s play again.”There are many otherfriendly things to say, too.Third, a child learns what to do to lose a game and win friends.
