131The Truth about Our Class ScheduleMy name is Hailey. I am in Mrs. Carlson’s class. Our class has two schedules.A schedule is a planned list of times and activities. One lists our special classes each week,and the times that we plan to start and finish them. Art and gym are on that schedule. Theother lists our subjects each day, and the times that we plan to start and finish them. Math,journal time, and science are on that schedule. The truth about schedules is that they are not people. Schedules don’t know anything. A schedule is paper with words on it. It’s a plan that stays the same, posted high on the wall so that everyone can see it. Mrs. Carlson knows a lot. Sometimes, she knows the planned schedule won’t work for our class. So, she tells my class what we will do. Here’s another truth about our class schedule: At any time, Mrs. Carlson can overrule the schedule. In this case, overrule means that Mrs. Carlson has more power than the pieces of paper with our schedules. If she tells us to do something differ- ent from the schedule, we try to do it.The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 237© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.Here’s an example of how that works. Last week, the class schedule listed art next, at one o’clock (1:00). Mrs. Carlson told everyone to put their math books away. All of a sudden, the fire drill sounded. Mrs. Carlson said, “Okay, fire drill. Line up at the door. We’re going outside.” She overruled our weekly schedule, just like that. The fire drill took so long that art was cancelled. A posted schedule is paper with a plan listed on it. At our school, most of the time, teachers have more power than schedules on paper. That’s the truth about schedules. n238 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
