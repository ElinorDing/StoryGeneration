165 Who Are the Crew? Every flight has a crew. Most crews have a pilot, co-pilot, and one or more flight atten- dants. They wear uniforms. That way, passengers know which people are members of the crew.  The pilot and co-pilot fly the plane. They have studied and practiced to learn how to fly a plane. The pilot and copilot work near the front of the plane in the cockpit. It’s their job to fly the plane and to lead the crew. Flight attendants work in the cabin of the airplane. They studied and practiced to learn how to keep pas- sengers comfortable and safe. The cabin has a small kitchen, one or more bathrooms, and many seats for passengers. The crew works to keep passengers comfortable and safe. n280 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
