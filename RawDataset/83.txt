81 It’s Easiest to Help People Who Want Help People often need help. They need help when a task is difficult to do alone. They may need help when doing something for the first time. Or, they may need help when they are in a hurry. If I notice a person who needs help, I may offer to help. My sister just learned to tie her shoes. She is practicing, but it still takes her a while to make the bow. I have been tying shoes for many years. I can tie shoes quite fast. Once in a while I might offer to help my sister tie her shoes. I may start by saying, “Do you want help tying your shoes?” It’s important to listen carefully for her answer. This is because it is easiest to help people who want help. When people want help, they cooperate with it. If my sister wants help with her shoes, she’ll cooperate with me. She might hold her foot so that I can tie her shoe easily. Or, she may smile because that help is here. Cooperation is a clue that my sister is happy to have my help. Most of the time, it’s easiest to help the people who want my help. n156 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
