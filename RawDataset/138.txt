136 Learning about Lines at School I am learning about lines at school. Knowing how to use school lines is important. On the playground, many children may want to use the slide. As one child slides, the other children wait in a line for their turn. Keeping the line pretty straight makes it easy to know who slides next. At the drinking fountain, many children may want a drink of water. As one child drinks the other children wait in a line for their turn. Keeping the line pretty straight makes it easy to know who drinks next. In the cafeteria, many children want to get their lunch. As a few children get lunch, the other children wait in a line for their turn. Keeping the line pretty straight makes it easy to know who gets their lunch next. Lines help children share the playground, drinking fountain, and cafeteria safely and fairly. Lines help children in other places at school, too! Keeping lines pretty straight makes it easy to know who’s ‘next’. I will try to practice what I am learning about lines when taking turns at schools, and other places, too! n244 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
