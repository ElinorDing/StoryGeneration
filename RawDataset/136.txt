134 It’s My Teacher’s Decision Teachers make many decisions for their class. A decision is a firm—and usually final—choice. Teachers make a lot of decisions, like who collects the lunch money and how to care for classroom pets. It’s their job. Teachers often make decisions about ideas from students. Asia has an idea. She wants to collect the lunch money today. Asia’s teacher, Miss Capel, decides who collects the lunch money. Asia asks Miss Capel, “May I collect the lunch money today?” “That would be fine,” says Miss Capel. “That would be fine” is a yes decision. This yes decision means that Asia may collect the lunch money today. Christopher has an idea. He wants to let Angel, the ham- ster, out of her cage. Miss Capel decides when Angel is out of her cage. Christopher asks Miss Capel, “May I let Angel out of her cage?” “Not right now, Christopher,” says Miss Capel. “Not right now” is a no decision. This no deci- sion means that Angel, the hamster, will be in her cage. Teachers make many decisions each day. My teacher makes decisions, too. Sometimes, my teacher may make a yes decision. Other times my teacher may make a no decision. Making decisions is a part of my teacher’s job. n242 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
