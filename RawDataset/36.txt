34 The Changes That Form Our Routine Each day, there are changes all around me. A lot changes from day to night and night to day. Whether it is day or night helps people figure out what to do. When the sun rises, the sky gets lighter. It’s morning. For me, it’s time for my morning rou- tine. It’s time to wake up, get out of bed, and start my day. When the sun sets, the sky gets darker. It’s evening. For me, it’s time for my evening rou- tine. It’s time to put on my pajamas and get ready for bed. Going from day to night or night to day is a big change. Going from night to day is a big change, too. The sun makes big changes that help me and everyone else know what to do! n 76 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
