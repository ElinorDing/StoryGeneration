91 Games Based on Luck Sometimes, children play board or card games. Many children like to play games. I am learn- ing about games, and how to stay calm and in control when I play them. Some games are based on luck. If a game is based on luck, it means that there’s nothing a player can do to win or lose the game. Players win because of luck. Candy Land® is a game based on luck. Children or adults win Candy Land® because they select the cards that get them to the finish line first. They do not have to think of a correct answer, or decide what to do, to win. They win because they were lucky to select those cards. Many children learn to stay calm if they win or lose a game based on luck. That way, others may want to play the games with them again! Sometimes I may play a game based on luck. Sometimes I may win. Sometimes I may lose. Winning or losing is not up to me or how I play. It is up to luck. I will try to stay calm and in control when I play a game based on luck. n168 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
