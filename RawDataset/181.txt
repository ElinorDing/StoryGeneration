179People Would RatherStay in their Houses People evacuate a house because they have to leave. If they had a choice, they would choose to stay and do what they  usually do. They wish the fire was out. They wish their home was farther away from the fire. They wish the fire was under control. Wishing doesn’t put a fire out, though. If it did, the fire would be out by now. By the time people grow to become adults, they have learned to do thingsthey don’t want to do without whining or having a tantrum. They may feel sad, nervous,or uncomfortable, but they know it’s important to keep thinking and working to keep theirfamily safe.Sometimes adults help themselves feel better by remembering that life isn’t always like this.They know that fires end and someday it will be possible to do the things that they usuallydo. That’s when adults say things like, “It will be nice when life gets back to normal.” Thathelps them to remember life without wildfires, and they feel better.If my mom and dad say, “It’s time to evacuate,” it’s important to follow their direction. nThe New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition 295© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
