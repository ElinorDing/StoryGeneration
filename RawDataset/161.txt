159 Fire Drills at School School buildings are safe places. Once in a very long while, a fire may start in a school. If this happens, it’s very important for everyone to calmly, quickly, and safely leave the building at the same time. This takes practice. So, principals schedule fire drills. During a fire drill, everything in a school is safe and okay. That’s the very best time to for teachers and students to practice leaving a school. A drill is practice that is done the same, best way each time. In a fire drill, each class has their own route to leave the building. This keeps people from bumping into one another. If there ever was a fire, a special route helps everyone get out of the building calmly, quickly, and safely. Once outside, each class has a special safe area. This is where they stop and count to make sure everyone is out of the building. Then they wait for the “all clear” signal to return to class. There is usually more than one fire drill each school year. Each time, every class leaves the school the same way. They go to the same area outside of the building. Most school buildings are safe all of the time. Once in a very long while, a fire may start in a school. Fire drills help teachers and students practice so that everyone knows how to leave the school calmly, quickly, and safely. n270 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
