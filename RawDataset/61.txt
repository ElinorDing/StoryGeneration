59 The Steps to Fort Able There’s a place called Fort Able. Fort Able is a very strong and safe place. It is a place in each brain where a person finds calm and control. It’s easiest for a person to do their best there. My name is ___________________. Fort Able is a place in my brain. It is where I am smart and make friendly choices. If I feel uncomfortable, out of Fort Able, I will try to find it again. The first step is to SAY to myself, _______________, Come to Fort Able! Or, _______________, ComFortAble for short. If I can’t find the first step, I will try to get help from My Team. The second step is to try to THINK of one of the rooms inside. Sometimes, just thinking about that room may help me feel better. I may be able to think smarter than I could a few mo-ments before. If I can’t seem to find the second step, I will try to get help from My Team. The third step is to GO inside. Once inside and comfortable again, I am able to do my best thinking. I may be able to solve the problem on my own. Or, My Team may be able to help me work things out, too.124 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.There are three steps to getting inside:• SAY—to myself, Come to Fort Able!• THINK—of a room there.• GO—inside.I have a place called Fort Able.
