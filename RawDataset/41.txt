39 The Transformers around Us LADYBUGS Life is full of real transformers. They change their form—and how they look—following a biological plan. A ladybug is a real transformer. Its life cycle is a biological plan with four stages. First, there’s an egg. Ladybugs lay their eggs on the underside of leaves near ladybug food. They aren’t eggs for long. Second, the egg hatches. Larvae come out. Larvae look like insects, with six legs and tiny hairs on the side. They eat and grow for about twenty-one days. Then they begin to change. The third stage is a pupa. This is the transformation stage. On the outside, a pupa looks still. It’s silent. On the inside, a lot is happening. The larva is changing into a ladybug. The fourth stage is the adult ladybug. They are red with black dots. They lay eggs, near food, that grow into larvae, and then pupa, to become ladybugs. Some of the changes around us are transformations that follow a plan, over and over again. They are quiet transformations that are an important part of Life on Planet Earth. n 82 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
