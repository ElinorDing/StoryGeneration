173 Children Are Important Passengers Children often help everyone on a plane have a safe and pleasant flight. Listening to parents and trying to follow directions is one way that children can help. I will try to help mom and dad when we fly. They can tell me about the rules for flying. I will try to listen and follow those rules. My mom, dad, and everyone around us in the airplane will be pleased if I follow the airplane rules. Pilots first—and moms and dads second— decide when it’s okay for people to take off their seatbelt or move around. Pilots decide when people can leave their seats. In every airplane there’s a little picture of a seat- belt. It’s also a light. When I am in the airplane, my mom or dad can show me where it is. There’s a little seatbelt sign in each row. The pilot turns the seatbelt sign on and off. If the seatbelt picture is on, that means everyone must keep their seatbelts on. It’s the law. I will try to listen to my parents and follow directions. This will help everyone to have a safe and comfortable flight. n288 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
