153 How to Write a True Story I am learning to use my writing box to write a true story. A true story describes something that really happened. Students often write true stories in journals. To learn to write a true story, I may try following these five steps. STEP 1 A true story is about real people. They are the characters in a true story. The main character is the most important person in the story. I may be the main character in my true story. Or, I may write a true story about someone that I know. I will try to choose a main character for my story. STEP 2 A true story often describes an experience. I have a writing box with photographs of real experiences. I may try choosing a photo to write about. STEP 3 People who read my story want to know who is in the photo, and where the photo was taken. This makes a good beginning to my story.
