79 Learning to Help Others Helping is doing something for another person. Being helpful is kind and thoughtful. Sometimes people ask for help. My mom may ask me to carry a bag. She needs my help. Or, my dad may ask me a question about the computer. He needs help. Other times, people may need help but do not ask for it. When this happens, it’s very nice to offer to help. There are many ways that I can be helpful. n154 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
