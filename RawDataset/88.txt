86 Restating with Respect I am learning about respect. Many children make mistakes with respect sometimes. This is called being disrespectful. They may use a disrespectful tone of voice or words. This can hurt others’ feelings or cause them to feel insulted or angry. Learning to talk with respect is a skill. That’s why children sometimes make mis- takes with respect. Children need to think, and practice, to talk with respect. When children make mistakes with respect, adults can help. When adults hear a disrespectful tone of voice or words, they will try to stay calm and say, “Restate with respect.” This gives children a chance to think and try again, using a calm tone of voice and cooperative words. When an adult says to me, “Restate with respect, please,” I will try to think and say it again using a calm voice and cooperative words. This will help to keep everyone’s feelings safe as we work and learn together. n162 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
