169 Moms, Dads, and Airport Security Sometimes, moms and dads are seri- ous or stressed when they go through security at an airport. It helps children to know why this happens, and what their parents may be thinking or feel- ing as they go through security. First, it’s a little harder for a family with children to go through security. Fami- lies have more stuff that they carry with them onto a plane. This stuff makes traveling with children easier and fun. It makes going through security a little stressful, though. Some items have to be unpacked and placed on the scanner. Moms and dads worry about getting everything through the scanner. They also worry about forgetting something when they repack everything afterwards. And, most important, they are keeping track of their children, too. They’ve a lot to do in a short time. Second, especially if there’s a long line, parents are hoping their children really cooperate and follow the rules. When moms and dads start thinking about the people who are waiting in line behind them, it adds to their stress. This is because they know others want to get through security quickly. Sometimes, moms and dads may try to get their children to move faster. Their children, though, may be distracted by interesting things, like the conveyer belt and the security scanner. Families going through security are a little slower than others. Sometimes moms and dads may seem serious or stressed. Knowing why they feel this way is helpful information for their children. n284 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
