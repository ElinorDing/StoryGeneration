167 What Does “Going through Security” Mean? Keeping passengers and crew safe on an airplane is very important. Going through security helps to find passengers or items that could be a problem on a flight. That’s why all passen- gers and crew have to “go through security” before they get on an airplane. There are airport officers that help everyone go through security. These airport officers are friendly with people who cooperate and suddenly serious with people who don’t. That’s because they are help- ing people and looking for problem people and items, all at the same time. Catching problems early is better than discovering them after the crew and passengers get on the plane. Going through security is one way to discover problems. Airport officers have a very important job. Cooperative passengers help everyone “go through security,” so that they can get on their plane. n282 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
