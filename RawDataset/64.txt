62 What Is a Gift? A gift is something special that one person gives to another person. A gift is often given to celebrate a birthday or holiday. If I give a gift to my mom, my mom owns the gift. If I give a gift to my dad, my dad owns the gift. If I give a gift to a friend, my friend owns the gift. A gift is something special that one person gives to another to keep. n132 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition Â© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
