146 Schoolwork is Practice School is where I learn about many things for the first time. School is where I practice what I learn. Practice is doing an exercise or activity over and over. Singers prac- tice. Football players practice. Cooks practice. Musicians practice. Golfers practice. Students practice. They all practice to make skills easier and to improve their performance. Many skills at school get easier and faster with practice. Reading new words is slower at first, easier and faster with practice. Solving addition or multiplication problems is slower at first, easier and faster with practice. Spelling new words is slower at first, easier and faster with practice. Teachers make assignments to give students practice with new skills. That way, skills become easier and students are ready to learn new things. I will try to complete assignments to prac- tice new skills. n254 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition Â© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
