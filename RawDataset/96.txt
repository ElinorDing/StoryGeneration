94 After a Game Ends Many people enjoy playing games. Most of the time, a game ends when someone wins. “I won!” also means that the game is over. Games are fun, but it’s good that they end, too. That way, people can go and do other things. Once in a while, it’s very good that someone wins. Everyone is getting a little bored. They are very happy when the game ends. Finally, they can go and do something else. Sometimes, everyone is so happy when someone wins and the game ends, it’s like everyone won! Other times, though, a game is really fun. Suddenly there’s a winner. The game is over. This is okay. Someone may say, “Let’s play again!” Most of the time, when someone wins the game ends. People are free to go and do other things, or to play the game again. n172 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.Bullying:What to Think, Say, and Do
