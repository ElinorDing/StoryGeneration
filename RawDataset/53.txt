51 Looking for Smiles Sometimes people smile when they are happy. If I were to look for smiles, where would I find them? I may find them on children playing. I may find them on moms reading sto- ries to children. I may find them on dads coming home from work. Happy can happen almost anywhere, and a smile is often found there. n102 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition Â© by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
