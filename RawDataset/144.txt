142 Restating with Respect at School I am learning about respect. Respect helps everyone feel welcome, comfortable, and safe. Learning to talk with respect to a teacher is a skill. Students need to think about, and prac- tice, talking with respect. Sometimes, a student may make mistakes with respect. A student may use a disrespectful tone of voice or words with a teacher. Talking disrespectfully to a teacher is a mistake. Teachers want students to do well, and to use respect with others. Whenever a student talks to my teacher, Mr. Westra, with a disrespectful tone of voice or words, Mr. Westra says, “Restate with respect, please.” “Restate with respect,” gives students an important second chance. This gives students a chance to think and say it again with a calm voice and cooperative words. This gives stu- dents a chance say the same thing, but with respect. If Mr. Westra says to me, “Restate with respect, please,” that means that I have made a mistake with respect. I will try to think and say it again using a calm voice and cooperative words. I will try to say it again with respect. Many students make mistakes with respect. With practice, they learn the skill of talking to teach- ers with respect. n250 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.
