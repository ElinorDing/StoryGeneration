124 This Place Is Busy! There are stores and restaurants ins my community. Sometimes, they get busy. There are clues that a place is busy. A place may be busy if: • There are a lot of people. • People have to move slower than they would like to. • To walk around, people have to stop to let others get where they are going. • There are one or more long lines of people. • There are many noises, and they are not just voices. • My mom isn’t smiling as much. • Someone I am with says, “This place is busy!” Some people enjoy busy places. Others do not. When parents enter a busy place, they may decide to stay. Or, they may decide to come back later or on another day. This is because it’s hard for some parents to stay calm and happy in a busy place.226 The New Social StoryTM Book, 15th Anniversary Edition © by Carol Gray, Future Horizons, Inc.If a place is busy, it may change our plans.
