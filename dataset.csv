When this happens, children need to ask for permission. An adult may say yes, without saying yes. This may be a little confusing for children. Sometimes, an adult will say, Sure Sure is a definite yes. The adult is very sure that itsokay to give permission. The adult feels confident giving permission. It may also meanthat permission in this case was not needed. Here is an example Jake Dad, may I do my homework now? Dad Sure Other times, an adult will say, Okay. Okay means yes. Okay may mean, Yes this time, but not every time. The adult feels comfortable giving permission. Here is an example Jake Dad, may Andrew and I do our homework together? Dad Okay. Another way that adults often say yes is, Okay, I guess, or, backwards, I guess it is okay. This means, Yes, but there is a good reason to say no. The adult feels a little uncomfortable giving permission. This is why children often act fast when an adult says, Okay, I guess. Jake May I watch one television show before starting my homework? Dad, Okay, I guess. When children have ideas and ask for permission, adults may say yes. How they say yes can be a little confusing.

For nearly twenty years, she has been modifying the guidelines for writing Social Stories, based on extensive personal experience and feedbackfrom parents, teachers, and the children themselves. The ideas and strategies have matured overthe years and Social Stories have now been examined independently in numerous research studiespublished in scientific journals. There is no doubt that the use of Social Stories in education andtherapy is what scientists describe as evidencebased practice. Social Stories really do work. Whenever I learn that Carol Gray is working on a new publication, I become quite excited in anticipation of reading her latest insights into how children with an autism spectrum disorders perceiveand experience the world. I know that her innovative ideas and strategies will be incorporated intomy clinical practice, and that I will be recommending the latest publication to teachers, parents,and colleagues. As I read the manuscript for the The New Social Story Book, I thought, Carol, youhave done it again She has written another exceptional resource that will improve not only socialunderstanding but also selfunderstanding. Carol has remarkable insight into the world of autismand the neurotypical world, and her Social Stories are for members of bothimproving mutualunderstanding, communication, and acceptance. This book is complementary to Carols other publications and provides examples of Social Storiesthat can be used without modification, or adapted and edited to suit a specific child and his or herunique abilities and circumstances. I recommend The New Social Story Book for those who are new tothe area of autism and Aspergers Syndrome as a parent, teacher, therapist, or psychologist, and alsofor those with considerable experience writing Social Stories. I often refer to my copy as a source ofguidance and inspiration when I am working with a child who has Aspergers Syndrome. From her extensive experience of working with children, parents, and teachers, Carol knows theproblem areasthe hot topics. These include coping with change, making mistakes, specificsituations such as attending a birthday party or being an airline passenger, and managing andexpressing emotions. Carol chooses her words very carefully. Great thought, wisdom, and talent went into this new publication. There are some parts I will always remember, in particular the state ment, Adults are children who kept getting older, and the Social Story for when some gifts are disappointing. I know that children with an autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical adults alike will enjoy and appreciate the comprehensive explanations and the sage advice in The New Social Story Book.

A popular movie opened last week at our movie theatre. My dad andI went to see it. We already had our tickets, and wanted to get some popcorn. There weremany people waiting in the lobby for the theatre doors to open. The popcorn was on theother side of the lobby from my dad and me. This was a good time for me to practice whatto say and do to move through a crowd. I began by facing the line for popcorn. Then I said, Excuse me. People began to move aside, so once in a while, I would say, Thank you. I kept moving slowly. I had to keep repeating excuse me every few steps. That way, I could use a friendly voice that was not too loud for a movie theatre lobby. A little smile seemed to help, too. With me in front and Dad behind me, we made it to the popcorn line a few slow steps at a time. Dad says he is proud that I practiced using Excuse me at the theatre.

It is okay for children to ask, Is it time to open the gift? It is important, though, to only ask that question a few times. This is because some people begin to feel grumpy if they are asked the same question too often. Adults often decide when gifts are opened. If I have questions about why I need to wait to open a gift, I may ask an adult."

"security, scanner, stuff, worry, child","Moms, Dads, and Airport Security Sometimes, moms and dads are seri ous or stressed when they go through security at an airport. It helps children to know why this happens, and what their parents may be thinking or feel ing as they go through security. First, it is a little harder for a family with children to go through security. Fami lies have more stuff that they carry with them onto a plane. This stuff makes traveling with children easier and fun. It makes going through security a little stressful, though. Some items have to be unpacked and placed on the scanner. Moms and dads worry about getting everything through the scanner. They also worry about forgetting something when they repack everything afterwards. And, most important, they are keeping track of their children, too. They have a lot to do in a short time. Second, especially if there is a long line, parents are hoping their children really cooperate and follow the rules. When moms and dads start thinking about the people who are waiting in line behind them, it adds to their stress. This is because they know others want to get through security quickly. Sometimes, moms and dads may try to get their children to move faster. Their children, though, may be distracted by interesting things, like the conveyer belt and the security scanner. Families going through security are a little slower than others. Sometimes moms and dads may seem serious or stressed. Knowing why they feel this way is helpful information for their children."

If airport officers tell you to do something that is not on this list, do it. Show your boarding pass and identifica tion to the first officer. Put shoes and cases on the conveyer belt to go through the scanning machine. Place other things in the bins as directed. Walk through the short security tunnel. Put items back in their cases, put on shoes. Following the directions for going through security helps the airport officers find problempassengers or items. This helps to keep everyone safe."

"disappointing, gift, angela, dinosaur, book","Some Gifts Are DisappointingMost of the time, a gift is a nice surprise. Once in a while, a gift may be disappointing. Thiscan happen when people give gifts to one another. Sometimes, disappointment is a surprising sadness. A person is happy and expecting something nice to happen. But it does not. That person is sad, and surprised to feel that way. Whenthis happens, disappointment is sadness that arrives fast and without warning.

Shethinks dinosaurs are boring. For Angela, getting a book about dinosaurs is disappointing. A gift may be disappointing when it is something that is not needed. Here is an example. Parker likes rocks, and has a big collection of books about rocks. Parker gets a gift from his grandfather. It is a book about rocks. But Parker already has the book in his collection. He is disappointed because he does not need two books that are the same. A gift may also be disappointing if the person opening it is hoping to receive one thing, and gets something else. Angela is hoping to receive a Barbie doll for her birthday. She opens a gift from her grandmother. There are socks inside. Angela may be disappointed to see socks, because she was hoping to see a Barbie doll. Almost everyone is disappointed by a gift now and then. For this reason, parents teach their children about disappointing gifts. In this way, children learn what to think, say, and do when a gift is disappointing."

This gives each person a place to sit on the plane. It does not leave a lot of room for people to walk. When fifty, one hundred, or more people get on a plane, the aisle fills up very quickly. A line forms out into the jet way. Meanwhile, other passengers are already in the airplane, getting settled into their seats. Sometimes they have to take off their coats, put their luggage away, or help another passenger. All of this takes time, especially when there are a lot of passengers. Jet way lines can be slow at times. Jet way lines often stop, then move, then stop, then move. Even so, it is the fastest way to get many people with bags and luggage down one aisle and into their seats. Most passengers would rather be in their seats than standing in a slow jet way line. They may feel a little uncomfortable or frustrated. It is important to try to stay calm. Sometimes thinking can help. Passengers may think, This is what happens when two hundred people get on an airplane, or, The line will move again soon, or, Others will wait for me when I am getting settled into my seat. Thinking to stay calm in a jet way is smart. I may use a jet way to get onto a plane. If there are many people, the line may move slowly.

When students work together, what isa good question?Mr. Haileys class is dividing into smallgroups. Each group will choose a city tostudy. What are good questions for thisproject?A good question may make a suggestionand ask others for their ideas at the sametime. One example is this I would like to doour report on Columbus, Ohio. What othercities could we study?A good question may invite others to joinin. One example is this Zachary, you wentto San Diego. Would that be a good city toadd to our list?A good question may show interest in what others are doing. One example is this Jackson,I loved the map you drew of downtown. Could you make a city map for our project? A good question may help add details to an idea. One example is this Jackson, what would you think about drawing a threedimensional picture of one of the streets in our city, too? A good question may help students work things out. One example is this Jackson, Darla wants to draw the city map. What would you think if she does the map, and you do a threedimensional drawing of one of the streets? That will save you time. Sometimes, help from an adult may be needed to find a solution. A good question may seek help from others. One example is this I would like to work on writing the report. But I will need help. Who can help with that? When students work in small groups, a good question is one that helps students share ideas or solve problems."

"firefighter, evacuate, fire, close, house","Why Do We Have to Go? Many children have questions about evacuation. Often they want to know why their family has to evacuate the house. Sometimes children will ask their mom or dad, Why do we have to go? When firefighters tell a family to evacuate, it is very, very, very important for people to leave their house. Firefighters have studied fires for a long time. They are fire experts. Firefighters decide when a fire is too close and people have to evacuate their houses. It is intelli gent to listen and follow their directions. Sometimes, it may seem that a fire is not that close. It may seem like it would be okay to stay. The problem is, when a fire is out of control it spreads quickly. That is why firefighters ask families to evacuate when it is still safe to go, before the fire is very close. Firefighters decide when a fire is too close. They tell people when it is time to evacuate. If a firefighter says, It is time to evacuate, it is time to evacuate. Following the directions of firefighters helps people stay safe."

They areright at home, describing how toilets work to a toddler, and are equally capable of describing the ins and outs of making an effective apology to an adult. As Social Stories keep pacewith their growing Audience, the topics, format, font, and vocabulary change as well. Bythe time a child reaches adolescence, the triedandtrue Social Stories yield to their moreadvanced form, Social Articles. My name is Carol Gray, creator of these articles, and it is mypleasure to introduce you to this rarely used yet valuable literary format. Social Articles meet all the same criteria as Social Stories, with several characteristics thatdistinguish them from their Storybased counterparts. Social Articles use a format thatincorporates Times New Roman font, columns, and advanced vocabulary. They are neverwritten in the Audience voice, and rarely contain any firstperson statements. Charts andfigures are frequently used to organize or highlight ideas and may replace more traditionalor elementary illustrations. Dr. Tony Attwood and I wrote the first Figure  Frequent characteristics ofSocial Article, Grays Guide to Com a Social Articlepliments.

I consider one of the Social Articles inthis chapter, Why People Take Baths orShowers, as the most elementary version of a Social Article. It lies right on the seamlessborder between Social Stories and Articles. The remaining articles in this chapter appear inorder of difficulty, each demonstrating several of the characteristics described previouslyand listed in Figure  above. One final note As I mentioned, Social Articles are never written in the Audience voice and thus, firstperson statements are often not included. However, the Author may serve as the voice of an article. In this case, the author introduces himself or herself and his or her background, with care to identify any personal opinions or bias as information is shared. This makes it possible to provide general insights and conclusions about social concepts and skills or to express opinions or share advice through an opportunity that would not be available otherwise. This is demonstrated in Apologizing for an Unintentional Mistake, which closes this chapter and volume. I hope you enjoy it. I wish you all the best as you develop Social Articles and, of course, Social Stories."

Sometimes, a person may chew gum, take it out, and chew it again,over and over. This is a mistake. It is not a healthy idea. I will try to leave my gum in my mouthuntil I am finished chewing it. Second, chewing gum with the mouth closed helps others. Many people do not want to see gum being chewed. It is a little gross. That is why people who chew gum try to keep their mouths closed. When I chew gum, I will try to think of how it looks to others. I will try to keep my mouth closed. The third gum manner matters long after the gum is chewed. It is about how gum is thrown away. Used gum belongs in a waste basket. It is sticky. If it is left anywhere else, it will stick to whatever comes along. Sometimes, that is somebody is shoe. Other times, it is somebody is clothing. To keep gum from sticking to other people, or to other things, it is important to throw it away correctly.

That means, I am going to use the shower. Soon, I will be learning to take a shower. What follows is a list of steps that many people follow to take a shower at home. It is a list of what they do and why they do it. TEN STEPS TO TAKE A SHOWER  Go into the bathroom and close the door. Closing the door keeps a shower private. Take off clothes. This keeps clothes dry. Turn on the water and set a comfortable water temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, a shower is uncomfortable. Hint Some people use the bathtub faucet to make sure the water temperature is comfortable, and then they send the water through the shower head. Make sure the water is coming out through the shower head. Step carefully into the shower. Wet surfaces may be slippery. Wash hair with shampoo, rinse, apply conditioner, rinse. Shampoo is soap made just for washing hair. Conditioner makes hair easier to comb and style. Rinsing well after the shampoo and conditioner is important for clean and comfortable hair and scalp. Wash skin with soap. This gets a body clean. Rinse. Rinsing well is important for clean and comfortable skin. When the shower is done, turn off the water. This saves water and energy. Use a towel to dry skin and hang up the towel. Dry skin makes clean clothes feel more comfortable. Hanging up the towel keeps the bathroom neat. It also prevents someone from saying, Hey, come back and hang up your towel. Put on clean clothes. Carry dirty clothes out of the bathroom. This helps to keep a bath room neat. I may use this list as I am learning to take a shower. My mom and dad know how to take ashower. If I have questions about taking a shower, they will know the answer.

Theother lists our subjects each day, and the times that we plan to start and finish them. Math,journal time, and science are on that schedule. The truth about schedules is that they are not people. Schedules do not know anything. A schedule is paper with words on it. It is a plan that stays the same, posted high on the wall so that everyone can see it. Mrs. Carlson knows a lot. Sometimes, she knows the planned schedule will not work for our class. So, she tells my class what we will do. Here is another truth about our class schedule At any time, Mrs. Carlson can overrule the schedule. In this case, overrule means that Mrs. Carlson has more power than the pieces of paper with our schedules. If she tells us to do something differ ent from the schedule, we try to do it. Here is an example of how that works. Last week, the class schedule listed art next, at one of the clock . Mrs. Carlson told everyone to put their math books away. All of a sudden, the fire drill sounded. Mrs. Carlson said, Okay, fire drill. Line up at the door. We are going outside. She overruled our weekly schedule, just like that.

An escalator is a good way to move people from one floor to another. On a staircase, people move up from one step to the next. On an up escalator, people choose a step and ride it to the top To be safe, it is important to hold the handrail. The handrail moves at the same speed as the step. This makes an up escalator comfortable and safe for people to use. Here is how to use an up escalator  Walk slowly to the bottom of the escalator. Pause just a little to decide which empty step to ride. Place a hand on the handrail next to that step. Look down, step with one foot, then the other, onto that step. This may be a big step. Ride up. To ride safely, stay on the same step. As the top gets closer, keep holding the handrail. At the top, the step begins to slowly flatten as it slides away under the landing. When this happens, let go of the handrail and walk off. Most escalators are wide enough for two people to share a step. Sometimes I may have myown step. Other times, my mom, dad, brother, sister, or someone else that I know may ridewith me. Once in a while, an up escalator may be very, very busy. There are people waiting to usethe escalator, and people on almost every step. When this happens, I may be told to share astep.
